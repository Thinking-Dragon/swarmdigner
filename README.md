Steps
- Create a robot class, which features the robot's position
## Ismail
- Create a grid
- Create a wave function which attributes probabilities to the grid
## fin ismail
- Visualize the grid with probabilities
## Clément
- Create a controller which executes each robot's decision at each time step
## Fin Clément
- Create a mechanism to deal with conflict
- Create a verification function that checks if all robots are on a highly probable square
## Olivier
- Create a function which allows robots to spread through the map
## Fin Olivier

- Creae an adjustement wave function which maximizes distance between robots once consensus is achieved
